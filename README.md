# Translate
Uses the translation.babylon-software.com/translate/script.php API for translations

This app is a web interface that accepts a text box of words, parses through each word, translates it, and then returns the translations in a table. It follows the format Literally 'word' means "definition" but can be modified to use any format. The app also strips formatting on copy and creates a text file that can be downloaded so it can be used in other software. 

The app is built using HTML and JavaScript. The interface was designed using Bootstrap. Translations are provided using the online service Babylon-Software using the script listed above. The table is also cached using HTML5 Local Storage

*Note, you must visit babylon-software.com before the app will function*
